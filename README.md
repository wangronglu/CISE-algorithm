# R and Matlab codes for CISE algorithm
CISE algorithm is for maximum likelihood estimation of M-GRAF model in the paper *Common and Individual Structure of Multiple Networks.* Lu Wang, Zhengwu Zhang and David Dunson (2017).
* CISE1_function.R is for estimating the M-GRAF model with $D_i = Q_i \Lambda_i Q_i'$.

contains R codes for the 3 variants of CISE algorithm and the HCP data with structural brain networks and levels of subjects' visuospatial processing.
We also provide matlab codes for the 1st variant of CISE algorithm.
