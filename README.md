# R and Matlab codes for CISE algorithm
CISE algorithm is for maximum likelihood estimation of M-GRAF model in the paper *Common and Individual Structure of Multiple Networks.* Lu Wang, Zhengwu Zhang and David Dunson (2017).
* CISE1_function.R is for estimating the M-GRAF model with D_i = Q_i * Lambda_i * t(Q_i).
* CISE1_fun.m is the Matlab version for this variant.
* CISE2_function.R is for estimating the M-GRAF model with D_i = Q_i * Lambda * t(Q_i).
* CISE3_function.R is for estimating the M-GRAF model with D_i = Q * Lambda_i * t(Q).
* bbnet68_spatial_orientation.RData contains the binary structural brain networks and levels of subjects' visuospatial processing from the HCP data.
* bbnet68_spatial_orientation.m is the Matlab version of the data.
